# Retro Arkanoid 3D

A 3D game inspired by the classic Arkanoid, built with the power of Three.js, React Three Fiber and Zustand.

## Technologies

for 3D graphics rendering this game uses:

**React Three Fiber**, a React renderer for Three.js, enables the creation of 3D scenes declaratively with reactivity and the power of React's ecosystem.

Physics and interactive game mechanics are powered by **@react-three/cannon**, a React hook-based physics middleware that integrates with React Three Fiber for natural physics in the 3D world. 

The game's immersive animations and transitions are made possible with **@react-spring/three**, providing a spring-physics based animation library that works harmoniously within the React Three Fiber ecosystem.
